## Understanding Java Volatile Keyword

The Java `volatile` keyword serves as a tool for ensuring visibility and ordering of variable accesses across threads in a multithreaded environment. Let's delve into its details:

### Basic Purpose

- **Main Memory Storage**: Declaring a variable as `volatile` indicates that its value will be stored in main memory instead of CPU caches, ensuring that reads and writes to the variable are directly performed on main memory.

### Variable Visibility Problems

In multithreaded applications, threads may maintain their own local copies of variables in CPU registers. Without proper synchronization, changes made by one thread may not be immediately visible to others, leading to visibility issues.

### Java Volatile Visibility Guarantee

- **Visibility of Changes**: The `volatile` keyword guarantees that changes made to a `volatile` variable by one thread are immediately visible to other threads.
- **Immediate Write-Back**: All writes to a `volatile` variable are immediately written back to main memory, and all reads are directly from main memory.

### Full Volatile Visibility Guarantee

- **Visibility of Related Variables**: When a thread writes to a `volatile` variable, all variables visible to that thread before the write are also made visible to other threads after they read the `volatile` variable.
- **Re-reading from Main Memory**: When a thread reads a `volatile` variable, all variables visible at that time are re-read from main memory.

### Instruction Reordering Challenges

- **Performance Optimization**: The JVM and CPU may reorder instructions for performance reasons while ensuring the program's semantics remain intact.
- **Challenge with Volatile Variables**: Reordering instructions can lead to issues with `volatile` variables, where the intended ordering of variable accesses may not be maintained.

### Java Volatile Happens-Before Guarantee

- **Happens-Before Relationship**: The `volatile` keyword provides a "happens-before" guarantee, ensuring that reads and writes to other variables cannot be reordered around reads and writes to `volatile` variables, preserving the intended program semantics.

### When is `volatile` Enough?

- **Atomicity Considerations**: If multiple threads both read and write to a shared variable, using `volatile` alone may not be sufficient to ensure atomicity. In such cases, synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks or atomic data types are needed.
- **Read-Only Operations**: If only one thread writes to a `volatile` variable and others only read, the `volatile` keyword guarantees visibility of the latest written value.

### Performance Considerations

- **Main Memory Access**: Reading and writing to `volatile` variables incur the overhead of accessing main memory, which is slower than CPU register access.
- **Preventing Instruction Reordering**: Accessing `volatile` variables prevents instruction reordering, impacting performance optimization techniques.
- **Usage Recommendations**: Use `volatile` variables judiciously, only when necessary for enforcing visibility, to minimize performance overhead.

Understanding the intricacies of the Java `volatile` keyword is crucial for developing reliable and efficient multithreaded applications.

```java
public class SharedObject {
    public volatile int counter = 0;
}
```

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int years;
    private int months;
    private volatile int days;

    public int totalDays() {
        int total = this.days;
        total += months * 30;
        total += years * 365;
        return total;
    }

    public void update(int years, int months, int days){
        this.years  = years;
        this.months = months;
        this.days   = days;
    }
}
```

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int years;
    private int months;
    private volatile int days;

    public void update(int years, int months, int days){
        this.days   = days;
        this.months = months;
        this.years  = years;
    }
}
```

```java
int a = 1;
int b = 2;

a++;
b++;
```

```java
public void update(int years, int months, int days){
    this.days   = days;
    this.months = months;
    this.years  = years;
}
```

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int years;
    private int months;
    private volatile int days;


    public void update(int years, int months, int days){
        this.years  = years;
        this.months = months;
        this.days   = days;
    }
}
```
