1. **Why are strings immutable in Java?**

   Strings in Java are immutable, meaning once a string object is created, its value cannot be changed. This design choice offers several benefits:

    - **Thread Safety:** Since strings are immutable, they cannot be modified by multiple threads concurrently, making them inherently thread-safe.

    - **Caching:** String literals are cached in the string constant pool (which we'll discuss later), which improves performance by reusing existing string objects rather than creating new ones.

    - **Security:** Immutable strings are inherently more secure because they cannot be modified after creation. This is crucial in scenarios like handling passwords or cryptographic keys.

    - **Hashing:** Since strings are immutable, their hash code can be cached, improving the performance of hash-based collections like `HashMap` and `HashSet`.

   Overall, immutability simplifies the handling of strings and contributes to the robustness and efficiency of Java programs.

2. **How `intern()` works?**

   In Java, the `intern()` method is used to place the string in the string constant pool. If another string with the same contents already exists in the pool, a reference to that string is returned. Otherwise, the string itself is added to the pool, and a reference to it is returned.

   For example:
   ```java
   String s1 = new String("hello").intern();
   String s2 = "hello";
   System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true
   ```
   In this example, `s1` is created using the `new` operator, but by calling `intern()`, its reference is replaced with a reference from the string constant pool where `"hello"` already exists. Hence, `s1 == s2` evaluates to `true`.

3. **How many objects are created in Strings using string literals and `new` operator?**

   When using string literals (e.g., `"hello"`), Java checks the string constant pool first. If the string exists, it returns a reference to that string; otherwise, it creates a new string in the pool. Therefore, only one string object is created in the pool for each unique string literal.

   When using the `new` operator (e.g., `new String("hello")`), a new string object is created in the heap memory regardless of whether the string already exists in the pool. So, in this case, at least one object is created.

   Therefore, using string literals can potentially create fewer objects since they leverage string interning and reuse existing objects.

4. **How does the string constant pool work?**

   The string constant pool is a special area in the Java heap memory where string literals are stored. When a Java program encounters a string literal, it first checks if an equivalent string exists in the pool. If it does, the reference to that string is returned; otherwise, a new string is created in the pool, and its reference is returned.

   This pooling of strings offers several advantages, such as reducing memory usage and improving performance by reusing existing strings. It's important to note that string interning (using `intern()`) is another way to add strings to the pool explicitly.

5. **Difference between `equals()` and `==` operator?**

    - `equals()`: This method is used to compare the contents of two objects for equality. In the case of strings, it compares the actual contents of the strings. For example:
      ```java
      String s1 = "hello";
      String s2 = "hello";
      System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
      ```

    - `==` operator: This operator is used to compare object references. In the case of strings, it checks whether two string variables refer to the same object in memory. For example:
      ```java
      String s1 = "hello";
      String s2 = "hello";
      System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (because of string interning)
      ```

   So, while `equals()` compares the contents of the strings, `==` compares the references of the string objects.

6. **Difference between `String`, `StringBuffer`, and `StringBuilder`?**

    - `String`: As discussed earlier, strings in Java are immutable. Once created, their values cannot be changed. This means any operation that seems to modify a string (like concatenation) actually creates a new string. Strings are good for scenarios where immutability and thread safety are important.

    - `StringBuffer`: This class is mutable, meaning its value can be changed. It is thread-safe, achieved through synchronization, which makes it slower than `StringBuilder`. `StringBuffer` is preferable in scenarios where multiple threads are working with the same `StringBuffer` instance.

    - `StringBuilder`: Like `StringBuffer`, `StringBuilder` is mutable, but it is not thread-safe. Therefore, it is faster than `StringBuffer` because it doesn't incur the overhead of synchronization. It is recommended for single-threaded scenarios where performance is crucial.

   In summary, use `String` when immutability is desired, `StringBuffer` when thread safety is needed, and `StringBuilder` when performance is a priority and thread safety is not a concern.
